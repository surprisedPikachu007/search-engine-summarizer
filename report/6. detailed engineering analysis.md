# Empathize

Our first step while developing the system was to empathize with the user. We laid out a few questions for ourselves to answer:

1. When searching in a search engine, what do we expect to see?
2. How much information do we expect to gain?
3. How much time do we spend on a typical search?
4. What are the most important factors that we consider while searching?

And then the idea of having a system that can provide us with the most relevant information in the least amount of time seemed like a good idea. To unserstand the problem better, we conducted a survey to understand the user's perspective. The survey was conducted on few students of our college.

We found out that most of the students spend around 5-10 minutes on a typical search and that they want to get the most relevant information in the least amount of time. Presenting the information in a concise manner is one of the best ways to achieve this. From the insights gained from the survey, we made a list of features that we wanted to implement in our system.

# Define

In this phase, we defined the problem statement and the scope of our project. The user, wants a system that will take in a query and produces a list of summaries. The manner in which the summaries are presented is also important. The user wants the summaries to be concise and relevant. A developer wants to be able to customize and integrate tools available to him. So an API is needed to be developed. This API be used as a backend in our system and also be used by other developers to integrate it into their systems.

Customization and personalization is important factors for a user. So we decided to implement a feature that will allow the user to customize the summaries according to his needs. Sorting based on relevance, date, length, etc., length of the summary, etc., are some of the features that we decided to implement.

# Ideate

With a firm grasp of user expectations and insights from the survey, we started the ideation phase. We started by listing out the features that we wanted to implement. We then started to think about the architecture of the system. We decided to use an API based architecture. This will allow us to integrate other tools and also allow other developers to integrate our tool into their systems. The system should also be modular so that it can be easily extended. The system will be a simple web search interface with a RESTful API as backend and a Web interface as frontend.

We chose to use Python as our programming language. Python is a very powerful language and has a lot of libraries that can be used to implement our system. We also decided to use FastAPI as our API framework. FastAPI is a very powerful and lightweight framework that is easy to use and has a lot of features. We will also be using NewsAPI to get the news articles. NewsAPI is a very powerful API that provides news articles from a lot of sources. For the frontend, we decided to go with ReactJS.

# Prototype

After the architecture was decided, we started to develop the system. We started by developing the API. It is a minimal web application. It has a single endpoint that takes in a query and returns a list of summaries. The frontend consisted of a search bar with a search button. It also had an "Advanced Search" button that allowed the user to customize the search. The user can choose the order of articles, category, location, etc.,

# Test

In the testing phase, we mainly focused on the following:

1. Functionality: Queries of varying complexities were fed into the system to assess its responsiveness, accuracy, and ability to generate concise and relevant summaries.
2. Integration: The integration of FastAPI, Python libraries, and external APIs such as NewsAPI was tested to ensure the system handles the workload efficiently and provide the user with the most relevant information in the least amount of time.
3. User experience: Our goals of usability, accessibility, and time efficiency were tested by having users interact with the system and provide feedback on their experience.
4. Performance: We put the system under varying levels of load to test its performance and scalability.
