# Possible solutions

Our proposed system is implemented as an API that simplifies the process of fetching and
summarizing relevant content based on user queries. When a query is provided as a parameter, the
system interacts with the NewsAPI to retrieve the corresponding content from various sources.
The received response, in the form of a JSON, is then parsed to extract the necessary information
about the articles. To create concise summaries, the system utilizes a summarizer module that
condenses the article content into key points. The summarized information is then returned as the
output.

The "summarizer" module consists of several functions that work together to retrieve and
summarize the latest articles based on user-defined arguments. The first function,
"getLatestArticles," takes arguments as input and interacts with the NewsAPI. It sends an API
request to "newsAPI" using the provided arguments and receives a response containing a list of articles. Next, the "summarizeArticles" function takes the list of articles as input. It iterates through
each article and applies the "htmlSummarizer" function to generate a summary for each article.
The "htmlSummarizer" function takes an article as input and returns a concise summary based on
the article's content. Finally, the "summarizeArticles" function returns a list of summarized
articles, where each article is associated with its corresponding summary.

Real-time summarization is another important feature of the proposed system. As new
information becomes available, the system will continuously update the summaries, providing
users with the latest and most accurate information. This real-time capability ensures that users
stay informed about current events and developments in their chosen topic. To offer a personalized
experience, the proposed system will provide options for user customization and preference
settings. Users will be able to specify the length and level of detail they prefer in the summaries.
This flexibility allows users to adjust the system's output according to their specific requirements
and reading preferences.
