# Possible solutions

1. One possible solution is to gather information from the results of a search engine and use a summarizing tool to create a summary of the results. But, a user becomes quickly tiresome of doing this manually. So, a better solution is to automate this process.

2. A script can be written to get the results and automatically summarize the results. But deriving context is not handled.

3. So, a better solution is to use a machine learning model to derive context and summarize the results.

## An ML based solution

A Machine learning model can be trained to produce summaries of text. The model can be trained on a dataset of text and it's summaries. But, the fundamental limitation to training any machine learning model is the availability of data. The more data available, the better the model can be trained. Hardware resources are also a limitation. With more data, the model becomes more complex and requires more hardware resources to train. A model trained with less data will not be very accurate. Since out main target users are students, we can't expect them to have access to large amounts of data and hardware resources nor we can produce low quality models. So, we need to find a way to train a model with less data and hardware resources.

A better approach is to use a pre-trained model. A pre-trained model is already trained on a large dataset and is very capable. We can fine-tune the model to suit our needs. This process is called transfer learning. Much like the way we learn new things by relating it to things we already know, a pre-trained model's knowledge can be transferred to a new model. This way, we can train a model with less data and hardware resources.
