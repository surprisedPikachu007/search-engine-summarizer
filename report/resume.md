The Search Engine Summarizer is aimed at reducing the time taken during a web search and to increase accessibilty. Such tool would be of great help to new knowledge seekers while increasing their productivity. Possible applications of the tool include: Aiding academic and research work, used alongside a search engine to provide concise summaries which can make the session more effective. A real world impact the application made was realised through the new summarizer API we created. It doubles down as a simple search engine where a list of summaries of the latest news articles are displayed when a query is submitted. The news summarizer tools was actively used by a tech blog writer and showcased its practical impract in aiding content creation. Compared to existing tools like SNS search which is old and falls behind in terms of performance and has old UI.
New tools like SenseBot falls short in performance and only returns minumum number of results. Powerful features like separating code blocks (for programming) are is reserved for future work. We also plan to develop tools that go hand in hand with a summarizer such as plagiarism checker, citation generator, note-taking tool, presentation maker etc., which would make the summarizer a one-stop solution for all academic needs. The limitations of the tool include the fact that it is not a complete search engine and only returns results from a single source. And in terms of latency it is slower than a search engine and takes noticeable time to return results. This is due to slow data collection and summarization process which we plan to improve in the future.
