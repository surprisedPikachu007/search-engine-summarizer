# I. Materials

## Hardware

- Disk space : 128GB
- Processor : 2-core CPU
- Memory : 4GB
- Display : Any display that supports 1024x768 resolution

## Software

### Frontend

- React.js (v16)
- Node.js (v12)

### Backend

- FastAPI (v0.96)
- Python (v3.10)
- Uvicorn (v0.22)
- sumy (v0.11)
- nltk (v3.8.1)
- newsapi-python (v0.2.7)

# II. COST

A virtual machine capable of running the software above cost around Rs. 1000 per month. News articles are fetched from the News API, which is free for 100 requests per day. The cost of the hardware is therefore Rs. 1000 per month.

# III. PRODUCTION PROCESS

## 1. Preparing Environment

An API key is obtained from the News API website. Python 3.10 is installed and the required libraries such as fastapi, newsapi, sumy, nltk, uvicorn, etc., are installed using pip. Node.js is installed and the required libraries such as react, react-dom, react-scripts, etc., are installed using npm.

## 2. Data Retrieval

The first step in implementing search engine summarization is to retrieve content from the web. news articles are retrieved from relevant sources. The collected data can be in the form of raw text, HTML, or XML. It is important that the data be relevant to the search query and is retrieved from reliable sources. This step is realized by using the News API.

## 3. Development

A virtual environment is created for the project. Django is used for the backend and React.js is used for the frontend. An endpoint is created for the backend to receive the search query from the frontend. The search query along with parameters such as number of articles, date etc., are passed to the newsapi client to retrieve the news articles. The news articles are then passed to the summarization module. The summarization module implements Sumy's parser with an English tokenizer. After removing stop words, summarization is done. The summary is then passed to the frontend. The search function calls the backend API with the search query and other parameters.

## 4. Testing and Deployment

The application is first tested by running it locally. Various search queries are tested and the results are verified. The API was iteratively improved to provide better results. After much testing and getting satisfactory results, the API is deployed as a web service on Render.com.
