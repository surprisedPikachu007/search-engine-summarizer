# II. COST

A virtual machine capable of running the software above cost around Rs. 1000 per month. News articles are fetched from the News API, which is free for 100 requests per day. The cost of the hardware is therefore Rs. 1000 per month.

# III. PRODUCTION PROCESS

## 1. Data Retrieval

The first step in implementing search engine summarization is to retrieve data from various sources such as articles, research papers, news articles, and other relevant sources. The collected data can be in the form of raw text, HTML, or XML. In this step, it is important to ensure that the data is relevant to the search queries and topics that the summarization tool is designed to handle.

## 2. Preprocessing

This step can also include text cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and other text pre-processing techniques. Once the data is collected, the next step is to pre-process the data. This step involves cleaning the text data, removing any unnecessary characters or symbols etc., Text pre-processing techniques like tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming is applied to improve the quality of the summarization.

## 3. Information Extraction

The pre-processed data is then analyzed to identify important sentences or phrases that are relevant to the search query. The pre-processed data is then analyzed to identify important sentences or phrases that are relevant to the search query. This step involves applying techniques like named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing to identify important concepts and relationships between them. The text rank algorithm ranks the sentences or phrases based on their importance and relevance to the search query.

## 4. Summarization

The extracted information is then used to generate a summary of the search results. ‘Sumy’ library is used for summarization. Finally, the ranked sentences are used to generate a summary of the search results. The summary should be presented in a way that is easy to read and understand. One popular tool for summarization is the 'Sumy' library, which provides various algorithms for generating summaries of text data.
