# The need for a solution is as follows

- People consume a lot of information from the internet on a daily basis. Therefore, having a system that can assist them in quickly finding the information they need is essential.
- Users with accessibility issues need more than just a search engine. The results should both be accessible and
- Sometimes a small summary of the information is enough for the user.
- Students and educators have special needs. Note-making, creating presentations, etc. are some of the tasks the system aims to help with.
- Confusing perspectives and opinions can be a problem for users and make them lose interest or get frustrated.

# Objectives

- To provide an easy-to-use interface that allows a user to enter a query and optional arguments, and receive a result set containing concise summaries/key information.
- To provide an API for advanced users to access the system's functionality programmatically. This will allow developers to integrate the system into their own applications.
- To present material online in a way that is user-friendly, clear, and accessible.
- To provide users with a personalized experience that aligns with their specific interests, preferences, or needs.
- To provide users with a set of tools to assist them in their research, including a citation generator, a note-taking tool, and a presentation generator.
