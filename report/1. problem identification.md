- The abundance of information available on the internet can be overwhelming for everyday users, who may not have the time or expertise to sift through large amounts of data to find what they need.
- Search engines and other tools often require users to manually sort through lists of webpages to find relevant information, which can be time-consuming and frustrating.
- Different types of documents (e.g., academic papers, news articles, and blog posts) may present information in different ways, using different formats, structures, and languages, making it hard for users to derive insightful conclusions from them.
- Users who lack prior knowledge or expertise in a particular topic may find it difficult to understand the information presented in online content, which may use technical language or assume a certain level of background knowledge.
- When users are under time pressure to find information, they may not have the luxury of reading through multiple documents to find what they need, which can lead to incomplete or inaccurate results.
- The quality of information available online can vary widely, with some sources being unreliable, biased, or inaccurate, which can make it difficult for users to determine what information is trustworthy and accurate.
- Non-expert users find it challenging to understand a material when its language and terminology are too technical or complex, like content related to science, technology, etc.
- The lack of personalized content presentation can hinder users from quickly accessing information that aligns with their specific interests, preferences, or needs.
- Accessing information from devices with small screens, such as smartphones may be difficult for some forms of content, such as long-form articles or academic papers, which may require users to scroll through multiple pages or zoom in on text to read it clearly.
- The accessibility of online content poses challenges for users with disabilities, such as visual impairments or cognitive limitations.
- Many existing search engines and content sources may lack proper accessibility features, which can makes it challenging for users with disabilities to access and understand information.
