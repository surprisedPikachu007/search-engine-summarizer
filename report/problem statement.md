Problem statement:
Existing search engines present Information in such a way that the user is expected to sift through the list of webpages and get information. But deriving usable conclusions from the large amounts of text takes a long time especially if the result set is large. It is made even difficult by the fact that there exists a lot of document types and each have their own style of presenting information.

- The abundance of information in the internet is overwhelming to the everyday user.
- The user is expected to sift through the list of webpages and get information.
- various types of documents present information in different ways, making it difficult to derive usable conclusions from the large amounts of text.
- if the user does not have prior knowledge of the topic, it is difficult to understand the information presented.
