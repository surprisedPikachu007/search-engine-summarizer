Abstract:

Information is what drives today's world, and the internet is filled with vast amounts of both structured and unstructured information. Search engines act as a gateway to search for and retrieve information. But the results returned by a typical search engine consist of a list of links to web pages. The user has to go through each of these links to find the information they are looking for. This process is time-consuming and inefficient. In this work, we present the Search Engine Summarizer - a system that takes a query and returns a result set containing concise summaries and key information. The system is developed by using Meta's Llama 2 model as a base model and fine-tuning it with our dataset of over 5,000 texts in different categories. We develop different models for different types of documents, which ensures high quality and modularity. The main goal of the system is to derive context and provide useful results catering to the user's query/need. The aim of this work is to develop a system that aids students, researchers, educators, and the general public in finding information quickly and efficiently. The system will serve as a guide to the user, presenting various types of documents in concise formats while retaining the original sources for further exploration, significantly improving the user's productivity. In addition to the summarization module, we also developed a set of tools to assist the user in their research. These tools include a citation generator, a note-taking tool, and a presentation generator. These tools will help the user in their research and academic work.
