Abstract:

The Search Engine Summarizer is an innovative application that provides a fast and efficient way for users to access information on any given topic. It is a unique search engine that stands out from traditional search engines by delivering real-time results of the latest and most relevant information from various sources including articles, blogs, forums, and more. This application uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as parsing, tokenizing, stemming, and summarizing to transform the content into clear and concise summaries.To gather the latest news articles, the Search Engine Summarizer uses the newsapi, a popular news aggregator that collects news articles from various sources. Then, it employs sumy, a Python library for text summarization, to create summaries of the articles. The process starts with parsing, which breaks down the text into its constituent parts. Tokenizing converts the parsed text into tokens such as words or phrases. Stemming reduces words to their base form, allowing for easier comparison between texts. Finally, summarizing condenses the content into a short, readable summary. The resulting summaries are presented to the user, providing fast and easy access to the most important information on their desired topic. This approach eliminates the need for users to manually browse through large amounts of content to find what they need. The Search Engine Summarizer is an ideal tool for researchers, students, and anyone looking to stay informed on current events. By delivering fast, efficient summaries of the latest information from a range of sources, the application offers a significant advantage over traditional search engines. The Search Engine Summarizer offers a user-friendly interface that allows seamless navigation and interaction. Furthermore, the API provided will make it easier for developers and advanced users to integrate the application into their own projects. With its unique combination of features, the Search Engine Summarizer is a powerful tool that can be used in a variety of ways. Whether it is used to stay informed on current events or conduct research, the application provides a fast and efficient way to access the latest information on any given topic.
